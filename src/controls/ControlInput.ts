     *  * When controls are close to one another, it is preferable to have their parents
     *    coordinate data transfer, e.g. by get() from one and set() on the other.
     *  * If controls that are not close to one another routinely need to share information
     *    it would be best to create an external datastore. Consider Redux or similar solutions.
