/**
 * Base type for System Acts that 'take the initiative'.
 *
 * An act is 'taking the initiative' if it represents a direct question or otherwise encourages the user to continue the conversation.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   * RequestValueAct  is-a  InitiativeAct.  Sample prompt: "How many ducks?"       (an explicit question requesting a response)
 *   * NextTaskAct      is-a  InitiativeAct.  Sample prompt: "Next task please."     (this is explicit encouragement to continue)
 *
 * Usage:
 *  * Introduce a new InitiativeAct for any behavior that is not precisely captured by existing acts.
 *    The is no restriction on creating as many act types as necessary for a new control or skill
 *
 *  * An InitiativeAct is not restricted to only represent initiative.  It is valid
 *    to represent both initiative and some content if they are fundamentally connected.
 *    However, it is usual to define separate acts if they can reasonably be used in isolation.
 *
 * Framework behavior:
 *  * The framework requires that every turn includes exactly one InitiativeAct except for
 *    terminal turns that stop the user's session. (by setting ControlResult.sessionBehavior)
 *
 * Remarks:
 *  * Alexa certification policy requires that each turn that leaves the microphone open clearly prompts
 *    the user to reply or continue. Hence an initiative act must always be present and rendered clearly.
 *  * If Alexa's reply doesn't not explicitly encourage the user to continue the conversation, the session must be closed.
