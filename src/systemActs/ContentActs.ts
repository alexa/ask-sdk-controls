 * Base type for System Acts that provides 'content' or 'simple information'.

 *
 * Examples:
 *   * ApologyAct  is-a  ContentAct.  Sample prompt: "A: Sorry, my mistake."         (simple information, no encouragement to continue)
 *   * WeatherAct  is-a  ContentAct.  Sample prompt: "A: The weather will be warm."  (business content, no encouragement to continue)

 *  * The framework requires that every turn includes exactly one InitiativeAct except for
 *    terminal turns that stop the user's session by setting `ControlResult.sessionBehavior`.
