 *
 * There are two more specific base classes that should be used as the base for user-defined SystemActs:
 *  * `ContentAct`: the base class for System Acts that just communicate some information.
 *  * `InitiativeAct`: the base class for System Acts that ask a question or otherwise encourage the user to continue the conversation.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  * Add `SystemActs` to the result in `Control.canHandle` and `Control.takeInitiative` to represent what the system wants to communicate.
 *  * Convert the `SystemActs` into surface forms (prompts, APL, etc) during the render phase.
 *  * Always extend `ContentAct` or `InitiativeAct` rather than this base type.
 *  * Introduce new System Acts whenever the available acts are not suitable or precise enough.
